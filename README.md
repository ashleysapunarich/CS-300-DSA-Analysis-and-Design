# CS-300-DSA-Analysis-and-Design



What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In this project, the solution is a working console application that can sort and search through a list of classes, giving information such as course number, course name, and prerequisites. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

Looking into the big O runtimes and ease of use, it was determined that hash tables would not be benefical to this type of project. Binary Search Trees were the faster option, but vectors were also able to be used as well. 
I approached this problem by identifying similarities in code between the three data structures and worked on my final code from there. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

A lot of my roadblocks were encountered during the coding process, but through the use of forums like stack overflow, I was able to better understand what went wrong in my code, and troubleshoot the issue. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This work has expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs because it was easily increasing my ability to work with data structures. I have struggled in the past with vectors, and this project
allowed me to continue and gain experience in working with data.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Continuing to code based on industry best practices will always help evolve the way in which I write programs as I continue to learn the best ways to code, and continue to improve on my coding in general. 
This has allowed me to keep improving on making more maintainable and readable code, versus the beginning of my coding experience where it was much less readable.
